Day 9: Last few days before Christmas 🎄

Can you believe we're already this far into December? It feels like it's absolutely flown by! Christmas is just around the corner now and things are probably starting to get a bit hectic with all the preparations and festive chaos.

I really hope you've been enjoying your time off so far - you deserved a proper break to relax and recharge. I know December can be a bit overwhelming with everything going on, but I hope you've managed to find some moments of calm and joy in there too.

We've already had some lovely times this month (glamping was incredible!), and there's still more to come. Plus, I'm really looking forward to seeing you again soon. Even though we might both be running around doing Christmas things, we should definitely carve out some time for us.

The countdown is on! Hope you're having a wonderful day whatever you're up to ❤️

P.S. - Don't stress too much about Christmas prep. It'll all come together, and what matters most is just enjoying the season 🎅
