Day 11: Hopefully you are in Ludlow 🏰

You made it! I'm so glad you're here - it means a lot that you wanted to come and see this part of my world.

Today is all about showing you around properly. Ludlow's actually a really lovely town once you get to know it - loads of history, beautiful old buildings, and some genuinely great places to eat and drink. I want to take you to all my favorite spots and share those little places that mean something to me.

We'll wander around at whatever pace you like - no rushing, just exploring. I'll point out all the interesting bits, tell you random stories about growing up here, and probably get a bit nostalgic about it all. And obviously, we need to find somewhere excellent for food because Ludlow actually punches way above its weight for restaurants.

I really hope you love it here as much as I do. There's something special about sharing your hometown with someone who matters to you, you know? Plus you've already met the dog, so you're officially part of the gang now.
