Day 3: First day of glamping 🏕️✨

Finally! The day is here! I've been so excited about this trip and getting to spend proper quality time with you away from everything.

Today is all about unwinding and soaking in the magic (literally). Picture this: you, relaxing in the hot tub with a glass of champagne in hand, watching the stars come out while I play fire keeper and make sure everything is perfectly cozy.

No rushing, no schedules, no stress - just us, the warmth of the fire, the bubbles of the hot tub, and the quiet of being away from it all. I want you to feel completely relaxed and pampered.

I'll handle all the "work" - stoking the fire, keeping your glass topped up, making sure the temperature is just right. You just focus on enjoying yourself.

This is going to be incredible 🔥🥂
