Day 8: :( I have to head back to Shropshire for the weekend 🏡

Ugh, I know - terrible timing right? Just when we got into a nice rhythm of seeing each other, I have to head back home for the weekend. Family duties call and all that. Trust me, I'd much rather be staying with you.

But here's the thing: even though I won't physically be there, I'm still completely available. Like, seriously - if you need me for anything at all, I'm just a phone call away. Want to vent about something? Call me. Need advice? I'm here. Just want to hear my voice? Ring me anytime.

And we can still have our virtual hangout time if you want - video calls, voice notes, sending each other random stuff we find funny. Distance doesn't mean we can't still be connected, right?

I'll be back before you know it, and honestly, the time apart just makes seeing you again even better. Missing you already 💙

(But seriously though, call me whenever. I mean it.)
