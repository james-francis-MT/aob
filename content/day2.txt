Day 2: Tea making coupon ☕

We both know how much you love a good cup of tea, and honestly, I love making them for you. There's something really nice about bringing you a perfectly brewed cuppa just the way you like it.

So here's your official tea making coupon - activate any time, anywhere, for an instant brew. Morning tea in bed? Done. Mid-afternoon pick-me-up? Absolutely. Late night tea while we watch something cozy? Say no more.

I'll even do the biscuit selection if you're lucky. Just one catch: you have to tell me exactly how you're feeling that day so I can make it perfectly. Strong and bold for busy days, or gentle and calming for relaxed evenings.

Your personal tea service awaits ☕
