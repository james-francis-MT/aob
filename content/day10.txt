Day 10: Join me in Ludlow? 🐕

So I've been thinking... how would you feel about coming to Ludlow with me? I know meeting the family can be a bit daunting, but I really want you to see where I'm from and spend some proper time there together.

Plus, and this is a major selling point, you get to meet the family dog! Honestly, this might be worth the trip alone because he's absolutely adorable and will definitely fall in love with you immediately. Fair warning though: once you meet him, he'll expect you to give him attention every single time you visit from then on.

We can make it a really nice visit - I'll show you around the town, we can grab food at some of my favorite spots, and it'll just be really lovely to have you in that part of my life. No pressure though, only if you're comfortable with it!

Let me know what you think. Either way, no worries at all, but I think it could be really special.

(Seriously though, the dog is a 10/10 good boy) 🐾
