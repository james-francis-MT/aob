Day 6: Three days with no plans 🧗‍♀️

So I just realized we've got three whole days coming up with absolutely nothing planned - how did that happen? Not that I'm complaining! Blank calendar days are the best because we can literally do whatever we want.

I've been thinking... maybe we could get a climbing session in? I know you've been wanting to get back to it, and honestly, I just love watching you figure out routes and absolutely smash them. Plus, climbing together is always a good laugh, especially when I inevitably get stuck and you have to coach me through it.

Or if you're not feeling the climbing vibe, we can do literally anything else. Cinema? Spontaneous day trip? Lazy day at home? Just hanging out and doing absolutely nothing? I'm genuinely happy with whatever, as long as I get to spend time with you.

Let me know what sounds good and we'll make it happen! No pressure, just want to make sure we actually do something with these days rather than letting them slip away 😊
