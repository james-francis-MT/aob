Day 5: All good things must end 🚗

I know, I know - our glamping trip is over and that's a bit sad. But hey, we've still got the whole day together before real life kicks back in, so let's make it count!

How about we take our time heading back and turn it into a proper little adventure? We could take the scenic route, stop wherever looks interesting, and just explore. Maybe we'll find a cute little village with a lovely cafe, or stumble upon somewhere with a great view worth stopping for.

And of course, there's always time for a cheeky pint at a country pub if we spot one that looks inviting. No rush, no deadlines - just us, good conversation, and making the most of our last day off together.

Plus, this way we can properly reminisce about the last few days and maybe start planning the next adventure. Deal?

Let's make this goodbye to our trip a good one 💕
