Day 4: Second day of holiday 🚶‍♀️🍺

Hope you slept well in our cozy little hut! Today I'm thinking we could explore the area a bit - nothing too strenuous, just a lovely leisurely walk to stretch our legs and see what's around.

There's something really special about countryside walks in December, isn't there? The crisp air, the quiet, maybe a bit of frost on the trees. Plus it gives us an excuse to hold hands and huddle close when it gets chilly.

And of course, what's a proper country walk without ending at a lovely warm pub? I'm talking proper hearty food, maybe a local ale or cider, sitting by a fireplace while we warm up and people-watch. Then we'll head back to our hut, probably overfed and very content, ready to enjoy another cozy evening.

Does that sound good? We can always just wing it and see where the day takes us. That's the beauty of having nowhere else to be 🥾❤️
