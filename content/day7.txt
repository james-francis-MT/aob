Day 7: Thank god its Friday 🎉

FRIDAY! We made it! And you know what that means - the weekend is officially here and we can actually relax without thinking about work tomorrow.

So here's the plan (well, my suggestion anyway): come round to mine tonight and I'll sort us out some proper good food. Nothing fancy necessarily, just something hearty and delicious that we can enjoy while we decompress from the week.

And honestly? You should just stay over. Like, why not? We can make it a proper cozy evening - good food, maybe watch something we've been meaning to catch up on, just properly chill. Wake up Saturday morning with nowhere to be and no rush to leave.

Though to be fair, you can stay over literally anytime you want - my door is always open for you. But Friday night sleepovers just hit different, you know?

So what do you say? Bring your overnight stuff and let's make it a proper Friday evening 💕
