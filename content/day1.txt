Day 1: Hug coupon 🤗

It's the 1st day of Christmas and I'm not even around to celebrate it with you properly - I know, terrible timing! But don't worry, I've got something to make up for it.

Consider this your official unlimited hug coupon, redeemable starting Monday on our glamping trip. And I mean unlimited - morning hugs, afternoon hugs, spontaneous hugs by the fire, cozy hugs in the hot tub... you name it.

I'm already counting down the days until I can wrap my arms around you. This weekend apart is going to feel so long, but knowing what we have planned makes it all worth it.

See you Monday, beautiful ❤️
